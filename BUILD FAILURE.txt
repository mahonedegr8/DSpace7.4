What you need to do is to edit the file

sudo nano dspace/config/local.cfg.EXAMPLE
change the 
db.password = with the password you entered twice after the command: createuser -U postgres -d -A -P dspace


save the changes to file local.cfg.EXAMPLE and save it as local.cfg, then run the command

sudo ant fresh_install
again and this will do it.
